# Photo Organizer Script ðŸ“·

## Overview
This PowerShell script automates the organization and copying of photos from a source folder to a destination folder.

## Features
- **User-Friendly**: Prompts for source and destination folder paths.
- **Organized Structure**: Sorts files into year and month folders, with user-defined subfolders for each file type.
